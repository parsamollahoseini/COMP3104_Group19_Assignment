Introduction:
DevOps plays a crucial role in modern Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
It transforms how software is built, tested, deployed, and maintained in production environments.

Key Benefits of DevOps in SDLC:

1. Faster Time to Market:
   - Automated deployment pipelines reduce manual work
   - Continuous integration enables frequent releases
   - Quick feedback loops accelerate development cycles

2. Improved Quality and Reliability:
   - Automated testing catches bugs early
   - Continuous monitoring ensures system health
   - Quick rollback capabilities minimize downtime

3. Enhanced Collaboration:
   - Breaks down silos between teams
   - Shared responsibility for product success
   - Better communication and transparency

4. Cost Efficiency:
   - Reduced manual intervention saves resources
   - Infrastructure as Code optimizes resource usage
   - Early bug detection reduces fix costs

5. Scalability and Flexibility:
   - Cloud-native practices enable easy scaling
   - Microservices architecture improves modularity
   - Container orchestration manages complex deployments

DevOps Impact on SDLC Phases:
- Planning: Continuous feedback informs priorities
- Development: Automated testing and code quality checks
- Testing: Automated regression and integration testing
- Deployment: Continuous deployment to production
- Operations: Monitoring, logging, and incident response
- Feedback: Real-time metrics drive improvements
