DevOps plays a crucial role in modern Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
It transforms how software is built, tested, deployed, and maintained in production environments.

Key Benefits of DevOps in SDLC:

1. Faster Time to Market:
   - Automated deployment pipelines reduce manual work
   - Continuous integration enables frequent releases
   - Quick feedback loops accelerate development cycles

2. Improved Quality and Reliability:
   - Automated testing catches bugs early
   - Continuous monitoring ensures system health
   - Quick rollback capabilities minimize downtime

3. Enhanced Collaboration:
   - Breaks down silos between teams
   - Shared responsibility for product success
